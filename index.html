            My name is Aaron, but in the internet, I usually go by Nenton. I am 15 years old, turning 16 next month. I use he/him pronouns and am a gay man out of the closet.<br><br>
            
            You may know me from TikTok as "Pancit Nenton" (@nentonxix), although as of the 5th of July, 2022, I have decided to quit social media for the sake of my own self-image and overall mental health, so I don't go there anymore, nor do I plan to for the following months, at least. I focus more on playing Project Sekai and PGR, and you can see my gameplays of the former on my YouTube channel!<br><br>
            
            I'm currently interested in Punishing: Gray Raven, Project DIVA, Project Sekai, VOCALOID, Kagerou Project, and Mitski. I'm planning to learn how to draw and how to speak Japanese, but just now I remembered how obsessed I was in HTML when I was in 5th Grade, so I decided to make this! I just wanted to see if I can make a blog website out of HTML instead of relying on Wordpress, like my other <a href="https://nentonscreativespot.wordpress.com/home" target="_blank">"blog"</a>.<br><br>
            
            I don't know what else I should put here, but there's that!
        <br><br>
        <a href="links.html">Links</a> shows a set of links to other places where I am (pretty much the Linktree page of this site) and <a href="posts.html">posts</a> is where all the posts are. The <a href="directory.html">directory</a> is usualy more organized, though.
