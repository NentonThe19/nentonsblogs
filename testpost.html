            I just wanna see how this turns out so I'll just place here the things I'm interested in... <br>
            <br>
            I am currently focusing on Project Sekai, I can currently clear up to Level 26 songs with a decent score (by decent I mean having 7 mistakes at most). The only song I can decently clear beyond that level is Sennen no Dokusouka (MASTER 27, which I can almost FC...) but I don't really count that because I don't think it should be a 27 (it should be a 24 at most imo it's way too easy to be in the same level as Tokugawa Cup Noodle Ban and TONDEMO-WONDERZ). My favorite human characters are Kohane and Tsukasa, but Ena and Toya are growing in on me. Akito too, although I hated him at first because of that chapter lmfao. My favorite groups are Vivid Bad SQUAD and WonderlandsXShowtime, if you couldn't tell.<br>
            <br>
            I also play Project DIVA X! And Project DIVA Future Tone <em>Prelude</em> because I couldn't get at least the Future Siund pack (my mom and sister were gonna buy it for me, but regional differences...) I've perfected all songs on PDX in Extreme EXCEPT for the Ending Medley. God is that hard. <br>
            <br>
            And, if you couldn't tell already, I love VOCALOID. I discovered VOCALOID during the last days of December 2018, and majority of my 2019 was me being obssessed with VOCALOID. I kinda had an on and off relationship with it during 2020, though, only sticking out for Evillious and Stellar Paradigm, and kinda abandoned it in 2021 because I was listening to more mainstream artists (Nicki Minaj, Doja Cat, Ariana Grande, etc.) but I returned to it earlier this year because my sister bought Project DIVA X for me December last year, but I started playing it more by February 2022, and I have improved so much since then. I couldn't even clear Holy Lance Explosion Boy back in February and now here I am. My favorite Vocaloid artists are Dasu and mothy, so it should be a given that my favorite Vocaloid series are Stellar Paradigm and Evillious Chronicles. But I'm currently getting into the Kagerou Project. My favorite VOCALOID is KAITO <del>(says the guy who listens to more Miku/Kagamine songs)</del><br>
            <br>
            Speaking of Kagerou Project, I'm finished with the manga, LNs, and anime. All that's left are the songs I have yet to hear, mostly album songs. My favorite Mekakushi Dan members are Konoha (and by extension, Haruka) and Kano, but Seto, Marry, and Ayano sure are running up... <del>I'm also starting to think I'm a Shintaro kinnie please send help</del><br>
            I was afraid of getting into the series at first because I was afraid it would be confusing, but then I thought "I'm an Evillious and FNaF fan. I'll be fine" and I was right. This was nowhere as confusing as Evillious. <br>
            <br>
            I also have been playing Punishing: Gray Raven since January, ever since a friend of mine online introduced me to it after we were ranting about Genshin Impact's lack of body diversity. I'm a Lee: Entropy and Camu: Crocotta main. I suck at the game, though, so it doesn't matter. I'm also currently pulling for the NieR characters BUT I AM LACKING THE BLACK CARDS I WISH I DIDN'T PULL FOR ALPHA OH MY GOD. My favorite character at the moment is Camu <del>because he's hot</del>.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking of Genshin, I played Genshin for a year (I'm not joking, I joined 6-29-2021) as an Anemo Aether main. My main team was C6 Anemo Aether, C4 Kaeya, C1 (or C2? I don't remember) Xinyan, and the Raiden Shogun. I had all the 4* characters including Kuki Shinobu and the 5* I had were the Raiden Shogun, C1 Mona, C2 Qiqi, Arataki Itto, Yae Miko, and Kamisato Ayato. I left the game because I was so disappointed in the fandom and HoYoverse because of the skin tone debacle happening lately, but I was already burnt out at the game (I planned to leave once I got Kazuha and Heizou)... I may return in 2.8, but I'm not sure about that. My favorite characters were Arataki Itto and Diluc.<br>
            <br>
            As for hobbies, my hobbies as of now are listening to music, rhythm gaming, content creation, and watching videos. I tried picking up my Japanese studies again but I got too lazy because of things and have not touched it for weeks as a result. I also tried learning how to draw again but I got lazy too. It felt like I was rushing too much, so I decided to lay off. I may pick up one of those, but I may also refresh my memory of HTML/CSS/JavaScript coding for the funzies. Just for this... It'll just be a hobby, though, so I won't get too deep in the details. I may also write stories again. But I don't know for sure.<br>
            <br>
            Alright, now to "post" this even though I won't be uploading this to GitHub until a few days later, but we'll see how this goes!
